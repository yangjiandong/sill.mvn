Configure

Add rspec-rails to the :test and :development groups in the Gemfile:

group :test, :development do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 2.0.1"
end
It needs to be in the :development group to expose generators and rake tasks without having to type RAILS_ENV=test.

Now you can run:

script/rails generate rspec:install
